# Hello TeamSnap!

Hi, I'm Dane! This is an app that reimagines the TeamSnap UI a bit. 
As it is a quick demo, be aware of possible:
 - Bugs
 - Unoptimized UI

This was tested on a Pixel 2, API 30, so fire up an emulator if you want to see what I was seeing.

Many things were not done, such as modularization, tests, etc., but it should get the point across.
